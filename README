Short description:
	-This project works as a shell that takes
	 user inputs and tokenizes each word or 
	 qoutation. The commands given to the program
	 are interpreted and seperate processes are 
	 produced for run, fly, and tovar commands.

	-Lists of data are stored into vectors (ie. tokens,
	 variables, values) for ease of manipulation.

	-All new processes are called using fork() and  
	 execv(2)
	
	-tovar command uses freopen, dup() and dup2 to redirect 
	 the standard output to a temporary file for writing.
